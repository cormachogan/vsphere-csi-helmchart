# Verify that CSI has been successfully deployed #

To verify that the CSI driver has been successfully deployed,
you should observe that there is one instance of the vsphere-csi-controller
running on the master node and that an instance of the vsphere-csi-node is
running on each of the worker nodes.

$ kubectl get deployment --namespace={{ .Release.namespace }}

$ kubectl get daemonsets vsphere-csi-node --namespace={{ .Release.namespace }}


# Verify that the vSphere CSI driver has been registered with Kubernetes #

$ kubectl describe csidrivers
